This project is a personal project and unconnected in ANY WAY to my day-to-day work. 
It contains no information or work in anyway derived from any system I have worked on in my professional duties. 
It is a personal project (part of a larger system I’m developing in my own time).

The basis of this system it to calculate for a Mollier diagram, 
the temperatures and pressures around Enthalpy and Entropy as experienced in a three stage steam turbine. 

The work will also require the SQL database and you will need to populate the database with data. Data such as the:  SI Properties of Saturated Steam and Saturated Water (Temperature) : Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University,  should be used. 
The data for this project originates from the book: 
“STEAM its generation and use”, 40th edition, 1992, Babcock and Wilcox.

As stated this is a personal project and not in any way connected to my professional work.
